## GUI-for-Tredmill-Dashboard
<p>
This is a Python programme written for Tredmill Dashboard with a GUI.
 <br>
As Undergraduates of the Faculty of Engineering University of Peradeniya, we created a treadmill dashboard with a GUI interface in our First year (2019).
<br>
In there all the coding parts were done using Python Programming language. 
<br>
This is a User-friendly system. Users can give their weight, and height before starting the treadmill. Apart from that users are requested to provide the number of revolutions and radius also to this system. (Depending on the situation we can take these parameters from the developer side)
<br>
Unit conversations are also allowed here. As you can see in the below figure, users can use any Unit which appears in the dashboard.
<br>
After giving all the necessary inputs users can start the system by pressing Start. Time will be calculated from that point onwards. As well stop and reset functions are also available in the system.
<br>
This system will display a real-time visualization of the result. The four parameters namely Speed, Distance, Burnt Calories, and StepCount will be displayed in the dashboard. Users can see how these parameters change while using this treadmill.
